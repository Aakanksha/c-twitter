c-twitter - Update your Twitter status from the command-line

This project is only designed for my use. Although, I suppose once I am done others could learn by what I have done.

The features of this project:
- Authenticate with Twitter over OAuth
- Update your twitter status

The goals of this project:
- get experience writing/learning c by writing an application
- use external c libraries to experiment with compiling, linking, and building
- choose an interesting real like problem to solve (one that I might actually want to use rather than just some math routine)
- the end goal is to be able to better contribute to open source projects that are written in c, in particular nodejs

See the TODO file for my progress on this project.
