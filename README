The purpose of this project:
- learn c language by writing something in c
- use external c libraries to experiment with linking
- write something that I might actually want to do not just some math routine
- the end goal is to be able to better contribute to open source projects, which will require more than just this project

This is not meant to be an application actually used by anyone other than me to update my own twitter status, though I suppose once I am done you could...
