The purpose of this project:
- learn c lanauge by writing something in c
- use external c libraries to experiement with linking
- write something that I might actually want to do
- the end goal is to be able to contribute to open source projects better

This is not meant to be an application actually used by anyone other than me to update their twitter status though I suppose once I am done you could...
