c-twitter - Update your Twitter status from the command-line

This project is only designed for my use. Although, I suppose once I am done others could learn by what I have done.

The features of this project:
- Authenticate with Twitter over OAuth
- Update your twitter status
- Potentially add more Twitter funcationality

The goals of this project:
1. be able to contribute to open source projects written in c such as nodejs
2. solve a modern & interesting problem (one that I might be asked to solve on the job)
3. gain knowledge in a harder language than ruby or javascript
4. get experience writing c applications
5. read C Programming Language (2nd Edition) aka K&R
6. gain a deeper and more historical understanding of programming
7. blog about my experience so that I may share it with others

See the TODO file for my progress on this project.
